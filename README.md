# Program Function
- Serves as an organizer tool for drone race director to host a race from start to finish
- Pilots can be preloaded or entered manually
- save the results after the race has been conducted

# OS compatibility
- PC/Widows

# Known Bugs
- Mac OS will crash when pilots are loaded from the showDialog

# Before you Start the Program
- If you know who will be attending the race, create an excel spread sheet and save it as a .csv
  Format your spread sheet to this style: PilotName, Band, channel number, channel frequency

- Doing this will allow you to load your pilots in and begin the race much faster
- Tip: save your .csv file on your desktop to find it easily
# Using the Program
## Race Setup:
- Once the Program has launched, click the start button which will bring you to the menu selection
- Inside the Menu Selection, if you have created your spread sheet, click load pilots to load your known pilots
- If you have any pilots that show up late to the race you can also enter them manually
- Once you have all your pilots entered, click the configure tab
## Race Configuration:
- Inside configure you will choose the amount rounds, heats, and place pilots into heats
- Enter the amount of rounds in
- Enter the amount of Heats
- Use the drop down menus to see your all your pilots and heats
- Choose desired pilot and heat, then click add. You will see your pilot inside the selected heat
- repeat the process untill your race is setup.
- Note: If you had pilots that did not show up, no need to add them. They will appear on at the end with scores of zero.
  which is how much fun they had because they didnt come to your race.
